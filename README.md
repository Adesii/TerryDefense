# TerryDefense
Is a Mix between XCom and a Tower Defense Game.

TiledCS from: https://github.com/TheBoneJarmer/TiledCS
without this library it would have taken me days to make Tiled maps work in S&box, i modified it to make it work in S&Box.

Also used the FlowField from: https://github.com/Facepunch/sbox-rts and some extension methods

Using this Triangulator for the Polygon shapes: https://github.com/kellygravelyn/Triangulator
