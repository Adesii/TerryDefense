# TerryDefense
Is a Mix between XCom and a Tower Defense Game.

TiledCS from: https://github.com/TheBoneJarmer/TiledCS
without this library it would have taken me days to recreate it, i just made it work in S&Box.

Also used the FlowField from: https://github.com/Facepunch/sbox-rts and some extension methods
